**A powerful and customizable in-game minimap plugin for Unreal Engine 5 racing games — built for both single-player and multiplayer. It features real-time player tracking, dynamic icons, seamless 3D-to-2D mapping, and easy UI integration.**

## 🎮 Features:

<br>

### 🧭 3D to 2D Auto-Mapping

The minimap automatically links player locations from the 3D world to positions in the 2D UI using a customizable **3D volume box** placed in your level.

- You can also **capture an overhead image** of the area covered by this volume  
  → Just press a Capture Map Snapshot button to generate a snapshot, which is then turned into a **texture**

- That texture can be used as a **base map image** in your minimap widget

<br>

### 🎨 Editable & Expandable UI Widget
Customize your minimap directly in the UMG editor:

- Maintains the correct aspect ratio of the 3D map automatically
- Scale the map freely or use the built-in dropdown slider
- Move and relocate the map bu **selecting and drag the map around**

> [!WARNING]
>> - For **free resizing**, select the image component and scale to your desired size
>> - For **relocation**, select and drag any map-related component (you don't need to select any specific component)

<br>

### 🧩 Icon Customization

Customize your **player** and **enemy** icons with full flexibility:

- The system uses **separate user widgets** for player and enemy icons  
  → This allows you to assign different **textures**, **colors**, or even animated elements using the full power of the **Widget Editor**

- Icon **size is preserved**  
  → The system automatically maintains the icon size you set in each widget.

> [!WARNING]
>> To ensure correct positioning on the map:
>> - It is better to **center the icon** within its **canvas panel top left corner** inside the widget editor
>> - This aligns the icon’s center with the actual 3D player location on the map

### 🧩 Overhead Image Capture (Map Basic Texture)

The system includes a **capture tool** that automatically aligns scene captures to the area covered by the minimap’s 3D volume. It gives you a quick top-down texture — perfect when you're frequently changing or updating your map.

- You can choose the **texture compression format** from a dropdown menu before capturing
- You can either **use a custom path** to save the captured texture, or let the tool automatically save it in a default folder inside the plugin

> [!NOTE]
> You can always change the texture’s compression settings later in Unreal’s **Texture Editor** — the tool just gives you **quick access** upfront


### 🗺️ Dynamic Mini-Map System
Supports:

- Real-time icon updates
- Player and enemy markers
- Smooth zoom and scale transitions

<br>

### 🧩 Plugin-Based Structure

> [!NOTE]  
> Tested in **Unreal Engine 5.5.4**. All plugins are **component‑based**, so you can easily bolt them onto existing code, and each ships with a small **demo map** that works in both single‑player and multiplayer.

> [!TIP]  
> To get started fast, drag the demo actor into your scene and follow the setup guide included in the plugin folder!
