# UE5 Multiplayer Racing Games – Plugin Collection

These plugins were developed while making **[Verocity](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3572320/Verocity/)** in our graduate “Game Production” class.  
They’re meant to let **artists and non‑programmers** drag‑and‑drop advanced multiplayer/single‑player features into any Unreal Engine project with no prior coding experience.
